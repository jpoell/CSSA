Package: CSSA
Title: Analysis and Simulation Tools for CRISPR-Cas9 Pooled Screens
Description: CSSA contains a number of functions to analyze and simulation pooled CRISPR-Cas9-based screens. The simulator, represented by the CRISPRsim function, offers an easy but also highly customizable tool to create data with guide- and gene-specific variables that can be randomly assigned and specified by the user. The analysis tools currently contain functions to calculate rate ratios, and a function that calculates effect sizes of gene knockout and guide efficacy based on rate ratios and duration of the experiment.
