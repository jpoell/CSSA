Package: CSSA
Title: Analysis and Simulation Tools for CRISPR-Cas9 Pooled Screens
Description: CSSA contains a number of functions to analyze and simulation pooled CRISPR-Cas9-based screens. The simulators, represented by the CRISPRsim and sortingsim functions, offer an easy but also highly customizable tool to create data with guide- and gene-specific variables that can be randomly assigned or specified by the user. The analysis tools currently contain functions to calculate rate ratios, odds based on nonparametric guide distribution, a function to combine genewise Z-values or odds, and a function that calculates effect sizes of gene knockout and guide efficacy based on rate ratios and duration of the experiment.
